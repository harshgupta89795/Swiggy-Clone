Swiggy is an Indian online food ordering and delivery company.
Founded in 2014, Swiggy is headquartered in Bangalore and
operates in more than 580 Indian cities, as of July 2023.[4]
Besides food delivery, the platform also provides quick
commerce services under the name Swiggy Instamart, and
same-day package deliveries with Swiggy Genie.

In 2011, Sriharsha Majety and Nandan Reddy designed an
e-commerce website called Bundl to facilitate courier
service and shipping within India.[6] Bundl was halted
in 2014 and rebranded to enter the food delivery market.[7]
Majety and Reddy approached Rahul Jaimini, formerly with
Myntra, and founded Swiggy in August 2014.[8][6][7]

By 2015, Swiggy expanded its food delivery operations
from just Bengaluru to eight Tier 1 cities across India.[9][10]
At the time, the food delivery sector was in turmoil as
several notable startups, such as Foodpanda (later acquired by Ola Cabs),
TinyOwl (later acquired by Zomato) and Ola Cafe (later closed)
were struggling.[6][7]

In January 2017, Swiggy started its cloud kitchen chain
called "The Bowl Company".[11] In November 2017, Swiggy
started a kitchen incubator business called Swiggy Access,
opening a network of ready-to-occupy kitchens for its restaurant
partners.[12] By 2019, over 1,000 Swiggy Access kitchens
were operational, according to a TechCrunch report.[13]
In mid-2018, Swiggy was operational in 16 Indian cities,
[14] which increased to 500 cities in 2019, matching the
scale of rival Zomato.[15]

In early 2019, Swiggy expanded into general product deliveries
under the name Swiggy Stores, sourcing items from local
stores.[16][17][18] In September 2019, Swiggy launched the
instant pickup/dropoff service Swiggy Go, allowing customers
to send document or parcel deliveries.[19][20] In April
2020, it rebranded Swiggy Go as Swiggy Genie.[21]
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it began doorstep delivery
of alcohol in the states of Jharkhand, West Bengal and
Odisha.[22][23]

In May 2020, Swiggy laid off 1,100 employees during the
COVID-19 pandemic.[24] The pandemic also resulted in the
shut down of more than three-fourths of its cloud kitchens.
